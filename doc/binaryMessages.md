# sbgECom Binary Messages {#binaryMessages}

The `SBG_ECOM_CLASS_LOG_ECOM_0 (0x01)` message class encompasses all binary messages that can be output by the device.  
In addition to outputting data, some messages can also be used to input aiding information, such as the [SBG_ECOM_LOG_AIR_DATA (36)](#SBG_ECOM_LOG_AIR_DATA).

The sbgECom binary logs are designed for high data rates with minimal payload size.  
This protocol is ideal for both real-time stabilization/navigation and post-processing applications. 

Each message encapsulates a coherent set of data and status information that can be fully interpreted without requiring additional context.
Users can configure the output rate for each message based on their specific requirements, optimizing the management of transmission bandwidth.

## Message Timestamping

Each log includes a monotonic timestamp in microseconds, representing the time since the sensor was powered up.  
This timestamp can be converted to GPS Time of Week (ToW) or UTC time using the  [SBG_ECOM_LOG_UTC_TIME](#SBG_ECOM_LOG_UTC_TIME) message.

When valid GPS time is available from a GNSS receiver, the `SBG_ECOM_LOG_UTC_TIME` message provides both the timestamp and the corresponding GPS/UTC time.  
This allows for straightforward conversion of any message timestamp to GPS/UTC time.

The following code sample demonstrates how to convert a message timestamp (`msgTimeStampUs`) to absolute GPS Time of Week in milliseconds.    
The variable `lastUtcMsg` holds the latest valid `SBG_ECOM_LOG_UTC_TIME` information received.

```C
  const uint32_t  gpsTimeOfWeekMaxMs  = 60ul*60ul*24ul*7ul*1000ul;
  
  int32_t         deltaTimeUs         = newMsg.timeStamp - lastUtcMsg.timeStamp;
  int32_t         newMsgTowMs         = lastUtcMsg.gpsTimeOfWeek + deltaTimeUs/1000;
  
  if (newMsgTowMs < 0)
  {
    newMsgTowMs += gpsTimeOfWeekMaxMs;
  }
  else if (newMsgTowMs >= gpsTimeOfWeekMaxMs)
  {
    newMsgTowMs -= gpsTimeOfWeekMaxMs;
  }
```

> [!NOTE]
> Timestamp to UTC time conversion is implemented in the `sbgBasicLogger` CLI tool.  
> For reference, you can review the `CLoggerContext` C++ implementation.

## Messages Availability

In each message definition, you'll find details about the availability of the message for specific products and the firmware version in which it was introduced.  
Some messages are specific to certain product capabilities, such as INS-only features or marine options.

For devices running up-to-date firmware, the new [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi) can be used to easily query the list of supported output logs.  
This can be done using a GET request to the following endpoint:

```sh
sbgEComApi -s COM1 -r 115200 -g /api/v1/messages/std
```

## Messages Versions

SBG Systems continuously improves its products by adding new features and outputs.  
This includes introducing new sbgECom binary messages and updating existing ones with additional fields and data.

### Payload versions

Each message payload definition specifies whether new fields have been added in various sbgECom releases.  
It is essential to determine the sbgECom version implemented by your device, as described [here](#SBG_ECOM_VERSION_DEF).

For example, the [SBG_ECOM_LOG_STATUS](#SBG_ECOM_LOG_STATUS) output log has been updated with two new fields over time, as shown below:

| Field                       | Description                                                                       | Unit | Format | Size | Offset |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|--------|------|--------|
| TIME_STAMP                  | Time since sensor is powered up                                                   | µs   | uint32 | 4    | 0      |
| GENERAL_STATUS              | General device status (see [STATUS_GENERAL_STATUS](#STATUS_GENERAL_STATUS))       | -    | uint16 | 2    | 4      |
| COM_STATUS_2                | Additional communication status (see [STATUS_COM_STATUS_2](#STATUS_COM_STATUS_2)) | -    | uint16 | 2    | 6      |
| COM_STATUS                  | Communication status (see [STATUS_COM_STATUS](#STATUS_COM_STATUS))                | -    | uint32 | 4    | 8      |
| AIDING_STATUS               | Aiding equipment status (see [STATUS_AIDING_STATUS](#STATUS_AIDING_STATUS))       | -    | uint32 | 4    | 12     |
| RESERVED_2                  | Reserved status field for future use                                              | -    | uint32 | 4    | 16     |
| RESERVED_3                  | Reserved field for future use                                                     | -    | uint16 | 2    | 20     |
| UP_TIME                     | System up time since the power on - 0 if N/A (added v1.7)                         | s    | uint32 | 4    | 22     |
| CPU_USAGE                   | Main CPU usage in percent - 0xFF if N/A (added v5.0)                              | %    | uint8  | 1    | 23     |

Each new field addition corresponds to a specific sbgECom version, allowing developers to understand the evolution of the message and implement backward compatibility when necessary.

### Backward/Upward Compatibility

New fields may be added to the end of a message payload over time, but fields are never removed to maintain backward binary compatibility.  
If a field becomes obsolete, it will be marked as reserved or deprecated.

If you use an older sbgECom implementation to parse messages from a firmware with a newer sbgECom protocol, the parsing should still function correctly.  
However, you will not have access to any new fields or features introduced in the latest firmware.

The sbgECom protocol implementation ensures compatibility by checking if a message payload meets the minimum required size.  
Any additional fields beyond this size are parsed optionally, based on the remaining payload data.

For reference on this mechanism, you can review the `SBG_ECOM_LOG_STATUS` message parsing implementation in the sbgECom C library.

> [!WARNING]
> If you implement your own sbgECom protocol and message parsing, avoid checking for exact equality in the received message payload size.  
> Instead, follow the sbgECom message payload parsing C implementation to ensure upward compatibility.
## Additional Messages

This sections covers output logs used to report device information, settings and for troubleshooting.

## IMU Measurements

This section details the messages used to report Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data as measured by the device's accelerometers and gyroscopes.  
IMU measurements represent physical quantities, specifically accelerations in (m/s²) and angular rates in (rad/s) expressed in the device's body frame (X, Y, Z axes).

All IMU measurements are factory-calibrated to compensate for thermal drift, alignment errors, scale factors, and non-linearity.  
The IMU data is ready for use in an Inertial Navigation System (INS) filter to compute the device's orientation and navigation solution.

Additionally, if any sensor frame alignment adjustments are made (such as rotating the device within a vehicle's frame), these will affect the reported IMU data.

> [!NOTE]
> For vehicle rotation rates and accelerations compensated for gravity, earth rotation rate and residual errors, please check [SBG_ECOM_LOG_EKF_ROT_ACCEL_BODY](#SBG_ECOM_LOG_EKF_ROT_ACCEL_BODY) message.

### IMU Data Synchronization Methods

Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data can be processed either synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the product series.  
The synchronization method determines how IMU data is collected, processed, and output in relation to the main INS computation loop.

#### Synchronous IMU

For products like the ELLIPSE series and IMUs such as the PULSE-40, IMU data is synchronized with the main computation loop of the device.  
Users can configure the output rate down to 1 Hz, with the device automatically downsampling the data using a moving average filter.

For instance, if the main sampling loop runs at 1 kHz and the output is set to 200 Hz, the device averages 5 samples to produce each output value.  
Consequently, if 200 Hz is requested for both IMU and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) data, exactly 200 messages per second for both IMU and EKF will be received.

#### Asynchronous IMU

High Performance INS products, such as the Navsight, Quanta, Ekinox, and Apogee series, operate with asynchronous IMU data.  
In these systems, the IMU and INS do not share a common clock.  
The IMU runs on its own clock, typically sampling at 200 Hz, while the INS operates its main processing loop also at 200 Hz but aligned with the GNSS time.

During each INS processing cycle, the latest IMU data messages are transmitted.  
Depending on the timing discrepancies between the IMU and INS clocks, there may be 0, 1, or 2 IMU messages per INS processing cycle.

For example, if the system is set to output 200 Hz EKF data and IMU data triggered on a new data event, exactly 200 EKF messages per second will be received, while the number of IMU messages may slightly vary, influenced by the IMU clock's offset relative to the INS clock.

### SBG_ECOM_LOG_IMU_SHORT (44) {#SBG_ECOM_LOG_IMU_SHORT}

The `SBG_ECOM_LOG_IMU_SHORT` message reports IMU data, including accelerations and rotation rates expressed in the IMU body frame, in a compact and efficient format.

For High Performance INS, this log is asynchronous and can only be triggered on a *New Data* event.  
For ELLIPSE v3 and IMUs like the PULSE-40, this log is synchronous ans can be output at any rate from 1 Hz up to the maximum rate supported by the device.  
Typically 1 kHz for ELLIPSE v3 and up to 2 kHz for IMU-only products like the PULSE-40.

To ensure the best dynamic range and LSB accuracy, measurements are provided using int32 integers with a fixed scaling.  
For high rotation rates above ~1833°/s, a different high range scaling is applied.

#### Converting to Physical Quantities

##### Temperature
The temperature is using a fixed scaling of 256 LSB for 1°C: *temperature = temperatureLSB / 256*

##### Accelerations

The accelerations are using a fixed scaling of 1048576 LSB for 1 m/s²: *acceleration = accelerationLSB / 1048576*

##### Rotation Rates

The rotation rates are using two different scaling:
  - *Standard Scaling*:   67108864 LSB for 1 rad/s if `SBG_ECOM_IMU_GYROS_USE_HIGH_SCALE` flag is **not** set.
  - *High Range Scaling*: 12304174 LSB for 1 rad/s if `SBG_ECOM_IMU_GYROS_USE_HIGH_SCALE` flag **is** set.

The device automatically switches to high range scaling when any rotation rate component exceeds approximately 1833°/s.

The following code snippet illustrates how to convert rotation rates from LSB to rad/s:

```C
  if (status & SBG_ECOM_IMU_GYROS_USE_HIGH_SCALE)
  {
    rate = rateLSB / 12304174.0;
  }
  else
  {
    rate = rateLSB / 67108864.0;
  }
```

> [!NOTE]
> Most SBG Systems products, such as the ELLIPSE, have a rotation rate range below 1000°/s and thus only use the standard scaling.

#### IMU Status {#IMU_STATUS}

The IMU_STATUS field is a bitmask that indicates the health and status of the IMU.  
Each bit represents a specific status flag, providing detailed information on various components of the IMU system.

> [!NOTE]
> **PBIT (Power-On Built-In Tests):** These tests are conducted once when the IMU is powered on, ensuring that all essential systems are functioning correctly at startup.  
> **CBIT (Continuous Built-In Tests):** These tests are performed continuously during operation, monitoring the health and status of the IMU components in real-time.
## Attitude, Velocity, Position

The following logs present the output of the navigation unit, vehicle attitude (represented by Euler angles and quaternions), velocity, and position data.  
These logs share common status flags and enumerations, which are detailed in the subsequent sections.

Additionally, this section includes logs that provide compensated vehicle accelerations and rotation rates.  
Unlike raw IMU data, these measurements have been processed by the INS Extended Kalman Filter to correct for sensor biases and scale factors.

Furthermore, the effects of Earth's gravity and rotation rate are also removed, providing data that accurately reflects the vehicle's true dynamics.

## Surge, Sway, Heave

This section covers output measurements specific to marine applications, including Surge, Sway, and Heave.

High-performance INS units with marine options support both real-time and delayed heave measurements.  
The ELLIPSE Series, however, offers real-time heave measurements only, without surge or sway channels.

Real-time heave delivers immediate data, whereas delayed heave offers higher accuracy with a 150-second time delay.

Real-time and delayed ship motion outputs share common conventions, message structures, status flags, and enumerations, as detailed below.

### Output frame and monitoring point

Ship motion measurements are defined in a vessel-specific coordinate frame:
- **Heave**: Vertical displacement, (positive downward)
- **Surge**: Longitudinal displacement (positive toward the bow/forward).
- **Sway**: Transverse displacement (positive toward the starboard side/right).

The heave measurements are affected by the selected output monitoring point and will be re-located accordingly.  
However, surge/sway/velocity and accelerations values are only valid when output at the IMU monitoring point.

### Ship Motion Status {#SHIP_MOTION_STATUS}

The status field indicates the validity and availability of the ship motion output fields.  
It is crucial to check this status to determine which fields are active and if the data is valid.

| Bit | Name                               | Description                                                                     |
|-----|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0   | SBG_ECOM_HEAVE_VALID               | Set if heave has stabilized (see [SBG_ECOM_HEAVE_VALID](#SBG_ECOM_HEAVE_VALID)) |
| 1   | SBG_ECOM_HEAVE_VEL_AIDED           | Set if the heave output is compensated for transient accelerations              |
| 2   | SBG_ECOM_HEAVE_SURGE_SWAY_INCLUDED | Set if surge and sway components are included in this output                    |

| 4   | SBG_ECOM_HEAVE_PERIOD_VALID        | Set if the swell period data is valid                                           |
| 5   | SBG_ECOM_HEAVE_SWELL_MODE          | Set if real-time heave uses swell mode computations                             |

#### SBG_ECOM_HEAVE_VALID flag {#SBG_ECOM_HEAVE_VALID}

The `SBG_ECOM_HEAVE_VALID` flag indicates whether the heave measurement is valid and stable, as it relies on high-pass filtering that requires convergence.  
This flag is cleared under the following conditions:
  - At startup or before convergence
  - After a turn occurs without velocity aiding
  - When heave measurements reach extreme values
  - If a significant step occurs, necessitating filter re-convergence
  - In the event of an internal system failure

### SBG_ECOM_LOG_SHIP_MOTION (09) {#SBG_ECOM_LOG_SHIP_MOTION}

### SBG_ECOM_LOG_ODO_VEL (19) {#SBG_ECOM_LOG_ODO_VEL}

This log provides the external velocity aiding expressed in meters per second, measured along the IMU/vehicle X axis (direction of travel).  
This velocity can be sourced from various speed sensors, such as a quadrature/pulse odometer or integrated CAN bus vehicles odometer.

The log is asynchronous and is sent whenever new velocity aiding information is available, such as when an odometer pulse is detected.

- **Message Name (ID):** `SBG_ECOM_LOG_ODO_VEL (19)`
- **Compatibility:** INS capable products
- **Firmware:** ![ELLIPSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/ELLIPSE-1.0-blue) ![HPINS](https://img.shields.io/badge/HPINS-1.0-blue)

**Timestamp Considerations:**  
This log is asynchronous, with the timestamp indicating the actual time of the velocity data, rather than the time when the log was generated.  
Consequently, the timestamp may slightly precede other data, such as IMU readings, that are sent simultaneously.

#### ODO_STATUS Definition {#ODO_STATUS}

| Bit | Name                   | Description                                                                        |
|-----|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 1   | SBG_ECOM_ODO_TIME_SYNC | Set if the velocity information is correctly time-synchronized.                    |

### SBG_ECOM_LOG_AIR_DATA (36) {#SBG_ECOM_LOG_AIR_DATA}

The airdata log provides barometric altitude above a reference level and true airspeed.  
The altitude is typically measured using a barometer, while the true airspeed is obtained from a pitot tube.

By default, the altitude is referenced to a standard 1013.25 hPa zero level pressure.

This log serves both as an input and output.  
It is sent by the unit when new internal airdata information is available.  
It can also be used to inject external altitude and true airspeed aiding information.

**Timestamp Considerations:**  
This log is asynchronous, with the timestamp indicating the actual time of the altitude/airspeed measurement, rather than the time when the log was generated.

When used as an input for external altitude aiding, the `TIME_STAMP` field may either represent an absolute time or a measurement delay, depending on the status flags.  
The measurement delay allows the INS to calculate an absolute timestamp based on the reception time, transmission delay, and the specified delay.

## Event Markers

SBG Systems products support multiple input and output events, facilitating precise timestamping and synchronization of various equipment.  
For example, an electrical signal can timestamp the exact moment a picture is taken.

SBG Systems' INS can align their internal clock with GPS time, providing a reliable solution for synchronizing devices and measurements to a common clock.  

### SBG_ECOM_LOG_EVENT_X (In/Out) {#SBG_ECOM_LOG_EVENT_XXXX}

The Event In/Out log is designed to efficiently timestamp events at up to 1 kHz, while being transmitted at a maximum rate of 200 Hz.  
This log can report up to five events detected in the last 5 ms, minimizing transmission overhead.

Depending on the product options, input/output signals such as Sync A, B, C, D, and E may be available, each associated with a corresponding message.

#### Operating Principle

The TIME_STAMP field marks the time of the first event received in the last 5 ms.  
Subsequent events in this window are recorded with time offsets, optimizing log size.

Additionally, SBG Systems products can generate output event markers, providing both an electrical sync out signal and a corresponding output log for precise timing.

**Example:**  
If three events occur within 5 ms:
- The first event's time is stored in `TIME_STAMP`.
- The second event's time is `TIME_STAMP + TIME_OFFSET_0`.
- The third event's time is `TIME_STAMP + TIME_OFFSET_1`.

Unused time offset fields are set to 0, and `EVENT_STATUS` indicates which fields are valid.
