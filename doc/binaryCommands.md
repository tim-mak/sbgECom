# sbgECom Binary Commands

SBG Systems products support a question/answer protocol to execute commands and actions through the sbgECom binary protocol.  
As of ELLIPSE firmware v3 and for all High Performance INS products, these commands primarily encapsulate [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/) GET/POST calls over serial interfaces.

For Ethernet-capable devices, the sbgECom binary commands are generally unnecessary, as traditional HTTP protocols should be used for all GET/POST requests.

All device actions, settings, and information are now managed via the [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/) rather than through sbgECom binary commands.

> [!NOTE]
> ELLIPSE firmware version 3.x still supports legacy sbgECom binary commands from version 2.x to facilitate migration.  
> However, users are encouraged to transition to the [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/) to leverage new features.

## General Principle

When a command is issued from the host to the device, the device may respond with an acknowledgment (ACK/NACK), or a specific payload.  
If a specific payload is returned, it shares the command identifier with the initial request, differing only in the payload data.

The sbgECom commands can be either accessed over standard serial interfaces or over virtual Ethernet interfaces.

### Serial Interface

SBG Systems products are equipped with multiple serial interfaces for both data output and device configuration.  
High Performance INS devices feature up to five serial interfaces (Port A to Port E), whereas PULSE IMUs may only have a single interface.

`sbgECom` commands are supported exclusively on Port A, meaning that all device configuration must be performed through this serial interface.  
Other serial interfaces are restricted to outputting `sbgECom` messages and do not accept configuration commands.

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed information and limitations regarding each serial interface, please refer to the product's hardware manual.  
> Ensure that the serial interface is not overloaded to maintain proper transmission of sbgECom commands.

### Ethernet Interface

High Performance INS products offer Ethernet connectivity with standard HTTP GET/POST support to access the [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/).  
This is the recommended method for configuring HPINS products using the JSON-based RestAPI.

Additionally, standard sbgECom commands can be used over the virtual Ethernet interface ETH 0.  
The other Ethernet interfaces (ETH 1 to ETH 4) are designated for outputting sbgECom messages or other supported protocols, such as NMEA.

Each virtual Ethernet interface provides a full-duplex input and output channel and can be configured for either TCP/IP (server or client) or UDP.  
The UDP option minimizes latency by eliminating readback but does not guarantee successful data transmission or reception.  
Both TCP/IP and UDP communications are secured with standard Ethernet CRC layers, ensuring data integrity.

Furthermore, High Performance INS devices automatically create an additional ETH CMD interface dedicated to sbgECom command communications.  
This interface is hardcoded to use UDP with a `52140` listen port and `52414` transmit port, and it is always active.

> [!WARNING]
> When using Ethernet, ensure that the INS is not receiving broadcast network traffic, as it may overload the CPU.  
> Broadcasting is generally not recommended in production environments.  
> If broadcasting cannot be avoided and results in a high volume of data being sent to the INS, consider isolating the INS on a separate sub-network.

## GET/POST (sbgInsRestApi)
High Performance INS products as well as new SBG Systems products use a new configuration and commands layer based on REST API concepts. REST API are very common in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and rely on Ethernet/HTTP connections.

The REST API is based on JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) specification only. The JSON is widely used in the industry and there are plenty of libraries available to manipulate JSON.

SBG Systems products’ offer REST API configuration and commands over Ethernet links using standard HTTP GET and POST methods. This manual doesn’t cover the sbgInsRest API usage and definition so please read the dedicated sbgInsRest API manual for more information.

The REST API can also be accessed and used over serial connections. This is this part that is covered in this documentation. The sbgECom uses two dedicated commands to execute GET and POST requests over a standard serial link.

### SBG_ECOM_CMD_API_POST (Class: 0x10 | ID: 47) {#SBG_ECOM_CMD_API_POST}

Execute a POST method on a specified sbgInsRestApi path.
The POST method is used to update a setting value or to execute a command.

Some POST paths require a body (ie a payload) while others, such as commands for a system reboot, have no body at all.

The example below, ask the device to save settings in FLASH memory:

```sh
/api/v1/settings/save
```

### SBG_ECOM_CMD_API_GET (Class: 0x10 | ID: 48) {#SBG_ECOM_CMD_API_GET}

Used to GET a resource from the device on a sbgInsRestApi path.  
For example, you can query the device settings or the device information / status using this command.

An optional query parameters string might be provided as shown in the example below:

```sh
/api/v1/settings?delta=true&format=pretty
```

This path query only the settings that have changed from the device default settings and pretty print the returned JSON.  
The path itself is `/api/v1/settings` with two query parameters {delta} and {format}.
