## External Aiding Protocols

Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can interface with various external equipment to enhance their accuracy by integrating aiding information.  
The most common external aiding device is a GNSS receiver, which typically provides data using the NMEA standard protocol.  
However, for optimal accuracy and robustness, SBG Systems also supports native binary protocols from leading third-party equipment manufacturers.

This section provides details on the supported third-party equipment and protocols, as well as their integration with SBG Systems' INS products.  
Note that the availability of these input protocols varies by product family and type and you should check your product dedicated user manual.

### sbgECom Input Protocol

The sbgECom protocol allows the INS to receive specific aiding information, such as external velocity or altitude (airdata).  
This binary protocol is compact and secure, making it ideal for injecting real-time aiding data.

The following sbgECom logs are accepted based on the aiding configuration:

- [SBG_ECOM_LOG_AIR_DATA (36)]{#SBG_ECOM_LOG_AIR_DATA}: Used by the AirData module to inject external barometric altitude and true airspeed.

> [!NOTE]
> Please refer to the dedicated Operating Handbooks for more details and code samples.

### NMEA Protocol

The NMEA protocol is commonly used for GPS aiding data in a read-only mode.  
The following NMEA sentences are expected for real-time INS integration:

This protocol allows the INS to interface with both primary and secondary positioning engines.  
It enabled a single u-blox F9P receiver to compute both a true heading solution and a standalone PVT (Position, Velocity, Time) solution.
