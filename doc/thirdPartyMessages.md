## SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_PD0 (02) {#SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_PD0}

The `SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_PD0` message is a proprietary binary log format from Teledyne RDI, primarily used for outputting Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) data, including bottom tracking, water tracking, and water profiling information.

This log can be generated by the Inertial Navigation System (INS) only if valid PD0 frames are received from a connected DVL device.  
The INS does not modify or supplement the PD0 data; it simply forwards the original PD0 frame as received.  
This feature is particularly useful for recording DVL data in the internal datalogger or for real-time output to be processed by third-party software applications.

For detailed information on the PD0 frame structure and its contents, please refer to the Teledyne RDI documentation.

## SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_SIMRAD_1000 (03) {#SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_SIMRAD_1000}

The `SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_SIMRAD_1000` message is a proprietary binary log from Kongsberg, primarily used for transmitting attitude and heave data to echo sounders.  
This logs provide roll, pitch, heading, and heave measurements, essential for marine survey applications.

All fields in this log are stored in Little Endian format (LSB first), with signed fields represented using standard 2's complement.

The log data is deported to the output lever arms configured for each output interface, ensuring precise measurements at specific points on the vessel.  
With the capability to output multiple SIMRAD frames across various interfaces, it allows seamless data integration for equipment located in different positions on a vessel.

### Time Format
The UTC time is divided into an integer seconds part and a fractional seconds part.  
The integer part is UNIX time counted from 1970-01-01 UTC.  

### Checksum

Checksum is calculated as a 16-bit Block Cyclic Redundancy Check of all bytes except the header and checksum.  
The CRC algorithm uses the polynomial 0x8408 with an initial value of 0xFFFF.

### Seapath Binary 26 Status Word {#seapath-b26-status}

The Status Word consists of 16 single-bit flags, numbered from 0 to 15, where position 0 is the least significant bit.  
If a bit is set (1), it indicates:

## SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_AHRS_500 (07) {#SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_AHRS_500}

The `SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_AHRS_500` message is a proprietary binary log that ensures compatibility with the Crossbow AHRS-500 series.  
This log outputs essential data such as attitude (roll, pitch, yaw), rotation rates, accelerations, and device status, enabling seamless integration with AHRS systems.

All values are stored in Big Endian format (MSB first), with 16-bit signed integers represented in 2's complement.  
While this message mirrors Crossbow's format, SBG Systems has implemented certain conversions to align with its AHRS/INS technology.

Each data packet begins with a two-byte header (`0xAA 0x55`) and ends with a two-byte checksum, ensuring data integrity.  
The checksum is computed by summing all packet contents except the header and checksum bytes, and then taking the result modulo `0xFFFF`.

### Status BIT Definitions {#status-bit-definitions}

The Status BIT field contains several status indicators to monitor the health of the product.  
A bit set to `1` indicates an error or performance degradation, while a bit set to `0` reports normal or optimal operation.

Please note that due to architectural differences, Crossbow AHRS-500 status may not directly translate to SBG Systems products.

Here's the improved and reformatted version of the ADA Data Packet message:

## SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_ADA_01 (08) {#SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_ADA_01}

The `SBG_ECOM_THIRD_PARTY_ADA_01` message is a proprietary binary log that encapsulates all INS, IMU, and status data within a single, compact frame.  
This message is designed for efficient processing on low-end platforms by using only integer representations with specific scaling.

All values are stored in Big Endian format (MSB first) and are encoded using 16/32-bit signed integers in 2's complement representation or unsigned integers.  
The status indicators align with those defined in standard sbgECom logs, ensuring consistent behavior across different log types.

The data packet begins with a two-byte header (`0xAA 0x5A`) and includes a two-byte checksum to ensure data integrity.  
The checksum is calculated as the sum of all packet contents (excluding the header and checksum bytes) modulo `0xFFFF`.

### Time Format

The UTC time is divided into an integer seconds part and a fractional second part. The integer part is UNIX time counted from 1970-01-01 UTC.

### KMB Status Word {#kmb-status-word}

The Status Word consists of 32 single-bit flags, numbered from 0 to 31, where position 0 is the least significant bit.  
A bit set to `1` indicates the following:

| Bit Position | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0            | Invalid INS position and velocity data, as defined by user quality thresholds.               |
| 1            | Invalid INS roll and pitch data, as defined by user quality thresholds.                      |
| 2            | Invalid INS heading data, as defined by user quality thresholds.                             |
| 3            | Invalid heave and vertical velocity data. The heave filter is not converged or has diverged. |
| 4            | Invalid INS acceleration data (NED). Same behavior as invalid INS position and velocity.     |
| 5            | Invalid delayed heave data. The delayed heave filter has not converged.                      |
| 16           | Reduced INS position and velocity data. Data is valid but the INS is not aligned yet.        |
| 17           | Reduced INS roll and pitch data. Data is valid but the INS is not aligned yet.               |
| 18           | Reduced INS heading data. Data is valid but the INS is not aligned yet.                      |
| 19           | Reduced heave and vertical velocity data. The heave is valid but not aided by INS.           |
| 20           | Reduced INS acceleration data (NED). Same behavior as reduced INS position and velocity.     |
| 21           | Reduced delayed heave data. The delayed heave is valid but not aided by INS.                 |
