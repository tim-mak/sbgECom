# Introduction

The sbgECom protocol is a binary protocol specifically designed for [SBG Systems](https://www.sbg-systems.com/) IMU, AHRS, and INS products.  
It includes commands for device configuration and output messages for reading data and status.

The sbgECom Library, the official C implementation of this protocol, is provided under the [MIT License](#license), enabling customers to accelerate their development processes.  
The library's usage is demonstrated with clear C code samples, and useful CLI tools with source code are also provided to facilitate evaluation and integration.

## Supported Products

SBG Systems offers a range of products, from miniature Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to survey-grade Inertial Navigation Systems (INS).  
The sbgECom protocol, documentation, and C library implementation are shared across all these products.

The product lines can be organized into the following main families, each with common features and firmware:

- **ELLIPSE Series v1/v2**: Miniature AHRS/INS launched in 2014, now superseded by ELLIPSE v3. Configured using sbgECom binary commands; does not support the [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/).
- **ELLIPSE Micro**: Ultra-small, cost-effective IMU/AHRS. Configured using sbgECom binary commands; does not support the [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/).
- **ELLIPSE Series v3**: The latest generation of ELLIPSE AHRS/INS launched in 2020 with a more powerful CPU. Supports the [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/) starting with firmware v3.0 (2024).
- **High Performance INS (HPINS)**: Includes EKINOX, APOGEE, QUANTA, and NAVSIGHT series. These are feature-rich, survey-grade INS products with Ethernet, data logging, and web interface capabilities. They share the same architecture and support the [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/).
- **PULSE IMUs**: IMUs including gyroscopes and accelerometers, with fewer features and configurations compared to INS. Supports the [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/).

> [!WARNING]
> This documentation primarily covers HPINS running firmware v4.x and above, as well as ELLIPSE v3 running firmware v3.x and above.  
> For ELLIPSE Series v1/v2, ELLIPSE Micro, or devices running older firmware, please refer to the previous [Firmware Reference Manual](https://support.sbg-systems.com/sc/dev/latest/firmware-documentation) and [sbgECom library v4.0](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgECom/4.0/).

## Configuration Overview

The sbgECom protocol and [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/) work together to provide comprehensive solutions for device configuration and data output.

### Device Configuration

The [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/) is a JSON-based REST API that supersedes sbgECom for configuring devices.  
It is the primary method for programmatically configuring products in newer integrations.

- **Ethernet Interfaces:** For products with Ethernet capabilities, such as the HPINS family, standard HTTP GET/POST methods are used to interact with the API.
- **Serial Interfaces:** For devices like the ELLIPSE v3, which use serial interfaces, the sbgECom protocol provides two specific commands, [SBG_ECOM_CMD_API_GET](#SBG_ECOM_CMD_API_GET) and [SBG_ECOM_CMD_API_POST](#SBG_ECOM_CMD_API_POST), to encapsulate [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/) GET/POST requests.

### Reading Data and Status

The sbgECom protocol implements [binary messages](#binaryMessages) for high data rate and efficient retrieval of measurements, information, and status.  
These messages are optimized for real-time applications, offering a secure and efficient binary format ideal for embedded systems.

These binary messages are also used in post-processing workflows, such as with Qinertia software, and for validation and troubleshooting.

> [!NOTE]
> The [sbgInsRestApi](https://developer.sbg-systems.com/sbgInsRestApi/) offers endpoints for querying information, status, and data at low frequencies (1Hz or less).  
> It should not be used for high-frequency data acquisition due to potential CPU overuse and the large data volume generated by JSON format.
